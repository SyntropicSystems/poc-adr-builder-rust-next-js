This folder contains artifacts used for the design and knowledge of the effort. They might evolve or not be consistent, while sharing the same core and idea.

This is not the folder for final recors, but a collection of documents to properly implement the system and idea.

Any design docs and decisions that are final and are used for living documentation should be created or moved outside of the .meta folder in the main repo.

You can see this folder for anything ephermal that is supporting the development but is not required to understand or execute the project itself. Similar to a VSCode file that supports the VSCode IDE but anyone can work on a project with a different editor not required to use VSCode workflows.
