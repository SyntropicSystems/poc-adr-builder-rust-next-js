# .meta

## Purpose

The .meta folder contains workspaces folder for the efforts or projects in this repository.

When to create a workspace is up to the user. The goal is to have dedicates folders for the meta artifacts or system of work, where code and core are in the repository, while leaving things that are not related to the system implementation out of the system.

This folder can be used to create workspaces by domain, effort, or only having a single workspace, and be used for project management, documentation, information dumps, and so on. Everything official that will be part of the final system and should live outside of the workspace itself, while custom configurations and artifacts that relate to the core system should live in the workspaces. This is similar to VSCode or others where IDE and system of work are separated from the atual implementation and things required for dev infrastructure.
