# Platform Framework Exploration

**Purpose**: Discovery and exploration phase for platform framework strategy
**Status**: Active Exploration
**Created**: 2025-10-24
**Stage**: Discovery → Design → Planning → Implementation

## 🎯 What This Folder Contains

This folder captures the **exploration and discovery phase** of our platform framework strategy. It's where we:

- Explore different approaches and options
- Document insights and discoveries
- Connect related concepts
- Preserve context and reasoning
- Build understanding before committing to design

**This is NOT**:
- ❌ Final architecture documents (those come later)
- ❌ Implementation specifications (premature at this stage)
- ❌ Detailed technical designs (too early)

**This IS**:
- ✅ Exploration of strategies and patterns
- ✅ Discovery of what's foundational vs emergent
- ✅ Context preservation for decision-making
- ✅ Knowledge graph of related concepts
- ✅ Foundation for future design work

## 📚 How to Use This Folder

### For Initial Exploration (Current Stage)
1. Read [INDEX.md](./INDEX.md) for the complete map
2. Follow links to explore related concepts
3. Add notes and insights as you discover them
4. Connect new concepts to existing ones
5. Update STATUS sections as understanding evolves

### For Design Phase (Next Stage)
1. Review all exploration documents
2. Extract stable concepts into ADRs
3. Create concrete architecture documents
4. Reference exploration docs for context
5. Update exploration STATUS to "Evolved into ADR-XXXX"

### For Implementation Phase (Future)
1. Use exploration docs for historical context
2. Reference design decisions when building
3. Update exploration docs with learnings
4. Document deviations and reasons
5. Feed learnings back into strategy

## 🔄 Document Lifecycle

Each document follows this lifecycle:

```
EXPLORING → MATURING → STABLE → EVOLVED

EXPLORING:  Active discovery, frequent changes
MATURING:   Patterns emerging, converging on approach
STABLE:     Ready to extract into design docs
EVOLVED:    Converted to ADR/design doc, kept for reference
```

**Update documents with status:**
```markdown
**Status**: EXPLORING | MATURING | STABLE | EVOLVED
**Last Updated**: YYYY-MM-DD
**Evolved Into**: [Link to ADR or design doc]
```

---

## 🎨 Document Format

Each exploration document follows this structure:

```markdown
# [Document Title]

**Status**: EXPLORING | MATURING | STABLE | EVOLVED
**Last Updated**: YYYY-MM-DD
**Related Documents**: [Links to related exploration docs]

---

## 🧩 Knowledge Graph Approach

Documents in this folder form a **knowledge graph**:

- **Nodes**: Individual documents (concepts, strategies, patterns)
- **Edges**: Links between documents (related concepts)
- **Navigation**: Start at INDEX.md, follow links based on interest
- **Discovery**: Non-linear exploration supported
- **Evolution**: Documents reference their descendants (ADRs, designs)

**Benefits**:
- Explore concepts in any order
- Understand relationships between ideas
- Trace evolution from exploration → design → implementation
- Preserve context for future decision-making
- Support non-linear thinking and discovery

---

## 📏 Quality Standards

**Before marking a document STABLE**:
- [ ] All sections filled with meaningful content
- [ ] Related documents linked
- [ ] Open questions addressed or moved to next stage
- [ ] Status and last updated date current
- [ ] Ready to be converted to ADR or design doc

**Keeping documents current**:
- Update status when understanding changes
- Add new insights as they emerge
- Link new documents as created
- Note when concepts evolve into design docs
- Don't delete - preserve history

---

## 🎯 Success Criteria

This exploration is successful when:
- ✅ Core strategy is clear and documented
- ✅ Foundational vs emergent distinction understood
- ✅ Extraction rules are concrete and actionable
- ✅ Technology integration patterns documented
- ✅ Implementation roadmap is clear
- ✅ Can confidently move to design phase
- ✅ All key questions answered or explicitly deferred

---

## 🔗 External Context

This exploration builds on:
- **ADR PoC**: [poc-adr-builder-rust-next-js](../../) - Reference implementation
- **FlowOS Pattern**: Contracts → Engines → Apps layering
- **Multi-Repo Strategy**: Google Repo tool approach
- **ADR Platform Architecture**: Rust + Python + TypeScript integration
- **CLI Tools Architecture**: Command patterns and testing strategies

## 📞 Getting Help

**Questions about exploration process?**
- Check [INDEX.md](./INDEX.md) for navigation
- Review document statuses (EXPLORING vs STABLE)
- Look for "Open Questions" sections
- Check "Next Steps" in related documents

**Questions about specific concepts?**
- Follow links between documents
- Check "Related Concepts" sections
- Explore the knowledge graph
- Read referenced external documents

---

## 🔄 When to Move to Next Stage

**Ready for Design Phase when**:
- Most documents marked STABLE
- Core strategy agreed upon
- Foundational infrastructure defined
- Extraction rules are clear
- Open questions resolved or explicitly deferred
- Team alignment on approach

**Triggers to create ADRs**:
- Architecture decision needs to be formalized
- Multiple people need to reference decision
- Decision affects multiple projects
- Future teams need context
- Risk of forgetting rationale

---

**Remember**: This is the **exploration phase**. It's okay to:
- Change your mind
- Update documents frequently
- Have open questions
- Explore multiple options
- Not have all the answers yet

The goal is **understanding and clarity**, not **final decisions**.
