# Research Reports

**Purpose**: Curated external research and analysis for platform architecture decisions
**Status**: Active Collection
**Created**: 2025-10-24
**Parent**: [Discovery](./../)

## 🎯 What This Folder Contains

This folder contains **external research reports and analyses** gathered to inform our platform architecture and technology choices. These are comprehensive deep-dives into:

- Modern developer platform frameworks and patterns
- Architecture paradigms (Infrastructure-Aware, Orchestration-as-Library, Cloud-Oriented Languages)
- Technology integration strategies for polyglot environments
- Best practices from established platforms (Encore, Temporal, Dapr, etc.)
- Workflow orchestration approaches
- Developer experience patterns

**This is NOT**:
- ❌ Our own internal architectural decisions (those are in ADRs)
- ❌ Implementation documentation (that's in project docs)
- ❌ Quick notes or snippets (those go in exploration docs)

**This IS**:
- ✅ Comprehensive external research reports
- ✅ Deep architectural analyses of existing platforms
- ✅ Curated insights from multiple AI research assistants
- ✅ Reference material for decision-making
- ✅ Context for understanding platform trade-offs

2. Choose reports based on your current questions or decisions
3. Take notes and highlight key insights
4. Connect findings to our specific context and requirements

### For Decision Making
1. Reference relevant sections when making architecture decisions
2. Use platform comparisons to inform technology choices
3. Understand trade-offs before committing to approaches
4. Document which research influenced which decisions (in ADRs)

### For Exploration
1. Use reports as starting points for deeper investigation
2. Extract patterns worth exploring in detail
3. Create exploration documents based on interesting findings
4. Link back to research reports for reference

## 🔄 Report Metadata

Each report includes:
- **Source**: Which AI assistant/research tool generated it
- **Date**: When the research was conducted
- **Focus**: Primary topics and platforms covered
- **Key Insights**: Main takeaways and findings
- **Relevance**: How it applies to our platform goals

---

## 🎨 Report Format

Research reports follow this general structure:

```markdown
# [Report Title]

**Source**: [Gemini/ChatGPT/Claude/etc.]
**Date**: YYYY-MM-DD
**Focus**: [Primary topics]
**Related**: [Links to related exploration docs]

---

## Executive Summary

[High-level overview of findings]

## [Main Content Sections]

[Detailed analysis and research]

## Conclusion/Recommendations

[Summary of key insights and recommendations]

---

**Note**: This is external research. Our decisions and adaptations are documented in exploration documents and ADRs.
```

## 🧩 Integration with Other Discovery Documents

Research reports feed into our platform exploration:

- **Research Reports** (here) → Inform → **Platform Exploration** → Guide → **ADRs**
- Reports provide external context and proven patterns
- Exploration documents apply insights to our specific context
- ADRs document our decisions and reference both research and exploration

**Flow**:
```
External Research → Internal Exploration → Architecture Decisions → Implementation
   (reports)      →   (exploration docs) →        (ADRs)         →    (code)
```

## 📏 Quality Standards

**Criteria for adding a research report**:
- [ ] Comprehensive and well-structured
- [ ] Relevant to our platform goals (polyglot, microservices, workflows, etc.)
- [ ] Provides actionable insights or deep analysis
- [ ] Cites sources or provides clear reasoning
- [ ] Adds unique value (not duplicate of existing reports)

**Report maintenance**:
- Reports are preserved as-is (historical reference)
- Add notes/commentary in separate files if needed
- Link to reports from exploration docs
- Update INDEX.md when adding new reports
- Tag reports with relevant topics for discoverability

---
